An optimistic vision of population genetics in the tidyverse

## The dream
I want to be able to analyze and work with population genetic data using the tools of the tidyverse.

Plans:

1. A tidy format for population genetic data (e.g. SNPs). Specifically aimed at translating VCFs to tidy data in a standardized way. 
2. Functions for quick subsetting of genotype data to facilitate local computation and visualization.
3. Functions for computing common population genetic statistics (pi, FST, Tajima's D, etc.) in the dplyr paradigm
4. Faciltation of visualization of population genetic data via ggplot
5. Functions for chunked local computation of basic statistics.
